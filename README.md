# New Member Training
This repository contains training materials for new programming students on the OZONE Robotics Team.

## How to Complete this Training
This is a self paced training, meaning you can work through the tutorials on the list below at your own pace. It's recommended that you complete the tutorials on the [list](https://github.com/olentangyfrc/New-Member-Training/edit/test/README.md#tutorial-list) below in order, however, if you already have experience, feel free to skip a lesson or two that you already know.

The tutorials are in documents linked in the [list](https://github.com/olentangyfrc/New-Member-Training/edit/test/README.md#tutorial-list) below, not actually in this repository. This repository contains the resources used in the tutorials.

To do the exercises, clone the entire repository, then enter the directory of the exercise for the tutorial you are doing. If you can't find the exercise you need in your local repository, trying pulling from github again as your version might be out of date.

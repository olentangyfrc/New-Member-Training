# New Member Training
This repository contains training materials for new programming students on the OZONE Robotics Team.

## How to Complete this Training
This is a self paced training, meaning you can work through the tutorials on the list below at your own pace. It's recommended that you complete the tutorials on the [list](https://github.com/olentangyfrc/New-Member-Training/edit/test/README.md#tutorial-list) below in order, however, if you already have experience, feel free to skip a lesson or two that you already know.

The tutorials are in documents linked in the [list](https://github.com/olentangyfrc/New-Member-Training/edit/test/README.md#tutorial-list) below, not actually in this repository. This repository contains the resources used in the tutorials.
